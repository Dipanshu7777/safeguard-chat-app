‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
A modern web browser.

A Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore enabled.

A deployed model API on Hugging Face Spaces.

Local Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Dipanshu7777/safeguard-chat-app.git
cd safeguard-chat-app

Configure Firebase:

Open the script.js file.

Find the firebaseConfig object and replace the placeholder values with your own Firebase project's configuration keys.

Configure the Model API:

In script.js, find the API_URL constant.

Replace the placeholder with the URL of your deployed Hugging Face Spaces API.

Run the application:

The easiest way to run the project locally and avoid CORS errors is to use a simple live server. If you have VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is a great option.
